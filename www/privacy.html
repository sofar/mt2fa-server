	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

	<p>mt2fa.foo-projects.org operates a service for Minetest
	players, and for Minetest server operators.</p>

	<p>This service allows players and server operators to
	register their identity and connect them to their personal
	email address. This provides players with the ability to
	control access to their player accounts on the Minetest
	servers that they play on. For server operators it provides
	them with a way to deal with player account control loss and
	gives them a form of player identification.</p>

	<p>In order for this service to function, the player, and the
	server operator, must provide their email address. This address
	is used to verify that when the player logs in to a Minetest
	server, it is actually the player from the registered email
	address. This verification is done by sending a confirmation
	link to the email address, and by the player clicking this
	link. In order for the server operator to use the service,
	they must also register and this is used to assure that the
	server that is exchanging information with the service is
	also properly identified.</p>

	<p>The service does not function without providing an
	email address. There is no way to use this service without
	registering an email address. If you do not want to provide
	your email address, then you may, in some cases, still play
	on Minetest servers which offer this service. On some other
	Minetest servers, you may not be permitted to play. This
	choice is dependent on the server operator, and not up to
	the mt2fa service provider.</p>

	<p>mt2fa.foo-projects.org collects the email address, and
	associates the Minetest servers' player name or server address
	with it if provided. This information is permanently stored
	on the mt2fa.foo-projects.org and is only used to provide the
	service to the player and server operator. The information
	is not sold or shared. From time to time we may publish usage
	reports that include service usage statistics, such as player
	count and server count, but not email addresses.</p>

	<p>The server maintains a limited amount of logging of events
	for auditing purposes. Logs are discarded after a certain
	time. These logs may contain the IP address and time of access
	of the service. These logs are not provided to anyone.</p>

	<p>Because of the nature of the service, you will receive
	email at the registered address. The only time we will send
	you email is when you are using the service and are performing
	requests to the service through logging in to the service or
	other ways to interact with the service. There is no way to opt
	out of any emails. You may choose to remove your registration
	from the service and remove your email entirely, but this will
	remove your ability to use the service, obviously. Currently,
	you can do this by email. If you do choose to exercise this
	option, please note that your associated player accounts
	on Minetest servers may become inaccessible or be deleted
	as a result. You may be required to confirm this process by
	verifying your email address, again.</p>

	<p>mt2fa.foo-projects.org is not operated by a company,
	a legal entity or an organization. mt2fa.foo-projects.org
	is not "economic activity" and makes no money from providing
	this service. This service costs money and this is paid out
	of pocket by the operator.</p>
